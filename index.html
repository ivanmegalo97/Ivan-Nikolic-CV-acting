      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a recent graduate from Brock University, where I have completed a Bachelor in Recreation and Leisure Studies (Honours), Community Recreation, with a Minor in Dramatic Arts. My experience to date demonstrates strong work ethic, exceptional communication and time management skills, as well as high adaptability. I am a strong team player, exemplified by a lifetime of working and engaging in sports, specifically basketball. Other strengths I have been able to develop to a high degree over the years, include being responsible, presentable and a personable individual with a mature attitude.
      </p>
      
      <p class="intro1">My experiences as a Residence Don combined with my sports and acting background, have allowed me to fulfil all my previous responsibilities, and engage with prospective students in an effective and positive manner. While studying courses within my program, I have learned the value of collaboration and have been able to improve my skills as a leader. Throughout my academic life, I have always strived to be an outstanding ambassador and role model to other students. My efforts have allowed me to obtain a position as a student prefect and Badger Brigadier at Brock University. Both positions required excellent communication, patience and understanding.
      </p>
